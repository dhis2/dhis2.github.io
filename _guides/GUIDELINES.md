This page contains various categories of guidelines related to DHIS2 web app repositories.

## README.md: what to include

All new and existing DHIS2 web apps should include a README.md file that contains relevant and updated information geared towards developers.

At a minimum, the file should include:

1. A sentence or two explaining what the app is/does
2. Links to the build and code quality status pages (see [d2-ui](https://github.com/dhis2/d2-ui) for an example)
3. Development info, including:
    * Any prerequisites
    * How to run the app in development mode
    * How to run the tests
    * How to deploy the app
