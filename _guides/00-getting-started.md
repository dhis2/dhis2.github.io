title: Getting started as a DHIS2 developer
category: guide
layout: page
---

We are happy to see that you choose to develop on the DHIS2 platform! We depend
on developers, both external and internal, to solve the challenges DHIS2 is
used for at all levels.

Thank you for joining our community of developers. :tada:

## Documentation

All our documentation is accesible through
[docs.dhis2.org](https://docs.dhis2.org/). There you can find version specific
documentation, from the bleeding edge in development now to old versions.

As a developer, you will most like find the *Developer guide* useful as it
contains the docs for the *Web API*.

## Source code

All our code is published under the DHIS2 organisation on Github. The way the
DHIS2 system is structured on Github is that
[dhis2-core](https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-core) contains the backend, which
serves the APIs which the frontend applications can communicate with. The
frontend apps are another story. Each application lives in its own repository,
and we use tags
for organisation.

## Get in touch with the community

DHIS2 hosts a platform to facilitate connections within the community. It is
the easiest way to get in contact with a growing number of DHIS2 developers,
implementors, project managers, and users.

### StackOverflow

Stack Overflow is another resource to get help with DHIS2. There is a `dhis-2`
tag you can use for your questions, or to provide and answer to someone else's question.

- [stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dhis-2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dhis-2)

### Mail lists

There are primarily two lists active, one aims at _developers_ and the other at
_users_.
