# DHIS2 Documentation

We write different types of documentation for different audiences, for
example, we write documentation in the code for our fellow developers,
both external and internal.

We write functional explanations over our system which explains how a
user interacts with our system.

For implementers we write a set of docs which explains how to install,
setup, and manage a DHIS2 instance "in the wild".

As core developers of DHIS2 we have the responsibility to write the
documentation which relates to our work. As frontend developers we need
to primarily write:

- code documentation, [dhis2.github.io](https://dhis2.github.io/)
- user documentation, [docs.dhis2.org](https://docs.dhis2.org/)

## Docbook

Our DHIS2 documentation for anything _except_ code lives in the
[dhis2-docs](https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-docs) repository and is
written in the XML-based
[Docbook](https://tdg.docbook.org/tdg/5.0/docbook.html) format.
