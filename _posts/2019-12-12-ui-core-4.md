As you might know, ui-core version 4 has recently been released. For the full list of changes, see our [changelog](https://github.com/dhis2/ui-core/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). If you prefer live demos check out [https://ui-core.dhis2.nu](https://ui-core.dhis2.nu), where we’re also hosting the API docs for ui-core.

To help you upgrade to ui-core@4 we’ll briefly go through the most important changes:

### React version

There has been a slight bump in the required react version, ui-core now requires at least react 16.8 and react-dom 16.8.

### Callback style

The callback style for ui-core components has changed. Previously any callbacks passed to our components would be called with the (react synthetic) event. We’re now calling all callbacks with an object with data first, and the (react synthetic) event second. To clarify, this is for example how the `onChange` prop on our `Input` component now works:

```
<Input
  name=“inputname”
  onChange={({ data, event }) => {
    const { value, name } = data;
    
    // the same as event.target.value
    console.log(value)
    // will log “inputname”, see the “name” prop above
    console.log(name)
  }}
  // other props omitted for clarity
/>
```

We’ve done this because ui-core@4 introduced non-native components, and this allows us to pass any custom data in the first argument (see `data` in the example above). To keep things consistent, we’ve adopted this pattern for all our components.

### Select deprecation

Speaking of non-native components, the Select component has been deprecated In favor of the new SingleSelect and MultiSelect components. They’re not backed by the native select element, and thus allow us to create a select component that is more in line with modern UI and UX expectations.

### New components

We’ve added several other new components: the Textarea, TextareaField, FileInput and FileInputField have also been added.

### Smaller changes

- The `Modal` now always renders (instead of accepting an `open` prop).
- Besides the user-facing changes listed above, we've added a lot of integration tests for our components. 

We hope the above is useful in your upgrade to version 4 of ui-core. Let us know if you encounter anything, and feel free to open an issue or PR!
