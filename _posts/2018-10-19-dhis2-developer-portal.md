Welcome to the (re-) launch of our developer portal. Over time we have amassed
a wide variety of documentation which resides in an equally wide variety of
places :sweat_smile:. The goal is to provide a single resource for developers
who work with the DHIS2 platform.

While this space has existed for some time, first as a manual resource, and
after that there was an attempt at a pure documentation driven resource, which
would pull all the `README` docs from our repos and join them into a united
whole.

The portal is an entry-point for _all_ DHIS2 developers, and we provide guides
to help you navigate the DHIS2 eco-system. Our [Getting started with DHIS2]({{
site.baseurl }}{% link _guides/00-getting-started.md %}) guide contains
information about where to find source code, documentation, and when you need
it -- where to find help.

In general, the **blog** portion of the portal will contain more fleeting
information like announcents, articles about how to implement and use a library
in your applications.

The **guides** section will contain information which is more static in nature,
for example how to set up a development environment for DHIS2.

A **libraries** page is in progress, with information about our suite of
tools we have developed as we work on DHIS2. 

There is an [RSS feed](/rss.xml) if you wish to keep up with new content on the
site, as well as a [sitemap](/sitemap.xml).

That's all for now. :wave:
